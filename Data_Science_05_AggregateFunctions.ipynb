        "1.  BeerName: The name of the beer.\n",
        "2.  Brewery: The name of the brewery that produces the beer.\n",
        "3.  Style: The style of the beer, such as \"Imperial IPA\" or \"Russian Imperial Stout.\" This categorizes the beer based on its taste, color, aroma, and other characteristics.\n",
        "4.  ABV (Alcohol By Volume): This represents the alcohol content in the beer, measured as a percentage. For example, a beer with an ABV of 9.2% contains 9.2% alcohol by volume.\n",
        "5.  NumRating: The number of ratings the beer has received on Beer Advocate, a popular beer rating website.\n",
        "6.  AvgRating: The average rating of the beer on a scale from 1 to 5, where a higher rating indicates a more favorable review.\n",

In Pandas, the `sort_values()` function is used to perform sorting on a Series or DataFrame. In our analysis of the Minnesota Beer data, we used the `sort_values()` function to organize data in a meaningful way. Here's a closer look at how we used this function:\n",

        "Remember, the concepts of mean and max are not limited to beer ratings. They are fundamental statistical tools that can be applied across various fields and contexts. Whether you're analyzing customer satisfaction, academic performance, or market trends, understanding how to use these functions can help you make informed decisions and uncover meaningful insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you've learned how to use the mean and max functions to analyze brewery ratings, think about how you can apply these concepts to other data sets and questions. The world of data analysis is vast and exciting, and these tools are just the beginning of what you can explore and discover!"
