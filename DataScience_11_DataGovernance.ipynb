        "# Introduction to Data Governance\n",
        "\n",
        "In today's world, businesses of all sizes rely on data to drive decisions, fuel innovation, and maintain a competitive edge. But with great power comes great responsibility, and this is where **data governance** becomes crucial. **Data governance** refers to the collection of processes, policies, and standards that ensure data is managed consistently, securely, and effectively across an organization. Its aim is to guarantee that data remains reliable, accessible, and compliant with regulations while protecting the interests of the business and its customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine the Mushroom Kingdom, where Mario runs a successful plumbing business alongside Luigi. As the company expands, it begins to collect vast amounts of customer data, from addresses and phone numbers to service history and payment information. However, without a system in place to govern this data, problems quickly emerge. Customer records might be duplicated or incomplete, sensitive payment data could be exposed, and regulatory compliance could fall through the cracks. Data governance provides the framework to avoid these pitfalls, ensuring that data remains both a valuable asset and a manageable one.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Core of Data Governance: Quality and Controls\n",
        "\n",
        "At its heart, data governance revolves around ensuring **data quality** and establishing **controls**. **Data quality** refers to the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of the data. For Mario's business, poor data quality might mean Luigi shows up at the wrong address or incorrect billing data leads to missed payments. Ensuring quality involves validating that data meets certain standards before it's used or shared.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Controls** are the mechanisms and policies in place to regulate how data is accessed, used, and shared within an organization. For instance, Mario and Luigi's company might have specific controls that limit access to sensitive customer payment information, ensuring only authorized employees (like Toad, their accountant) can access it. These controls are critical for maintaining data security and compliance with laws like the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** or the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, which dictate how personal data should be handled.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Data Governance Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand the importance of data governance, consider what happens when it is neglected. Without governance, organizations are more likely to encounter **data silos**, where information is stored in isolated systems, making it difficult to access and use effectively. For example, if Mario's customer data is scattered across different databases---some local, some in the cloud---retrieving comprehensive customer information can become a nightmare. Additionally, the lack of consistent data practices can lead to **data breaches**, putting sensitive customer information at risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data governance ensures that data remains consistent across systems, is accessible to the right people at the right time, and adheres to both internal policies and external regulations. It establishes a culture of accountability, where everyone---from data stewards to IT administrators---understands their role in maintaining data integrity and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A Look at Nintendo Businesses: A Governance Case Study\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a closer look at a business scenario from the world of Nintendo to illustrate how data governance might work in practice. Suppose Princess Peach runs a high-end catering service for royal events in the Mushroom Kingdom. The catering service uses a Postgres database to store everything from supplier information to customer preferences, as well as payment details.\n",
        "\n",
        "To manage this data effectively, Peach's business must implement a data governance strategy. This strategy might include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Access Policies**: Only authorized staff members, such as the head chef and financial manager, have access to certain records.\n",
        "2.  **Data Quality Checks**: Regular checks ensure that supplier contact information is accurate and up-to-date.\n",
        "3.  **Data Security Controls**: Payment data is encrypted and masked to protect customer privacy.\n",
        "4.  **Data Retention Policies**: Old event records are archived or deleted after a specified period to minimize storage costs and comply with data protection regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple example shows how data governance can enhance both operational efficiency and security while safeguarding valuable business information."

        "### 2\\. **Access Requirements**\n",
        "\n",
        "Access to data is a balancing act between availability and security. On one hand, you want employees to access the data they need to perform their jobs efficiently. On the other hand, unrestricted access could lead to data breaches, misuse, or regulatory violations. This is where **access control** comes into play. **Access control** refers to the policies and technologies that restrict access to data based on specific roles, responsibilities, and agreements.\n",
        "\n",
        "In any well-governed business, access to data is not a free-for-all. Rather, it is governed by a set of principles that determine who can access what data, and under what conditions. Let's explore these principles through examples from businesses in the Nintendo universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most common ways to manage access is through **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. **RBAC** ensures that access to data is based on an employee's job role within the organization. Roles are predefined, and permissions are assigned accordingly. This minimizes the chances of unauthorized access and ensures that each person only has access to the data necessary for their work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine Mario and Luigi's plumbing business. Mario, as the business owner, needs access to all customer records, financial reports, and staff performance data. Luigi, the operations manager, needs access to customer service history and job schedules but not financial data. Toad, their accountant, requires access to payment information and financial records but doesn't need to see customer addresses. In this setup, each individual has access to the data relevant to their role, and nothing more.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example RBAC Table for Mario's Plumbing Business:**\n",
        "\n",
        "| **Role** | **Access Level** |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| Mario (Owner) | Full access to all data |\n",
        "| Luigi (Operations) | Customer records, job schedules |\n",
        "| Toad (Accountant) | Financial records, payment information |\n",
        "| Daisy (HR) | Employee records, payroll data |\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup mitigates risks and keeps the business running smoothly by preventing accidental or intentional data misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "### User Group-Based Access\n",
        "\n",
        "In some businesses, roles can overlap, and this is where **user group-based access** becomes essential. **User group-based access** assigns permissions to specific groups rather than individual roles, allowing for flexibility when roles change or when employees need to collaborate across departments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider Princess Peach's catering service. The kitchen staff might all be part of a \"Catering Operations\" group with access to supplier orders, inventory lists, and customer dietary restrictions. However, none of them need access to financial data or supplier contracts, which are reserved for the \"Management\" group. This structure not only simplifies access control but also helps when new staff join or move between roles, as they are automatically assigned the correct access permissions based on their group.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Use Agreements\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important layer of access control is the use of **Data Use Agreements (DUAs)**. A **DUA** outlines how data can be accessed, shared, and used, particularly when third-party vendors or contractors are involved. These agreements help protect sensitive data by specifying the legal and operational constraints around its usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, Bowser's villain consulting firm regularly hires external analysts to conduct competitive research. Before gaining access to Bowser's client data, each analyst must sign a DUA, agreeing to specific conditions, such as using the data only for approved projects and deleting it after the contract ends. DUAs ensure that third parties understand their responsibilities when handling sensitive information, reducing the risk of data misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Release Approvals\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, access to data might require formal **release approvals**. This is especially relevant when sharing data externally, such as with business partners or regulators. **Release approvals** are typically used to ensure that the data being shared complies with all internal policies and regulatory requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Zelda, managing the royal archives of Hyrule, must follow a strict release approval process before sharing any sensitive historical or personal data. Every request for data is reviewed by a committee, and approvals are granted only after verifying that the data will be used appropriately and securely. This ensures that data sharing happens in a controlled manner, protecting both the data and the interests of the kingdom.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Balancing Access and Security\n",
        "\n",
        "Managing access effectively requires balancing availability with security. Granting too much access can expose a business to risks, while being overly restrictive can hinder productivity. The key is to design access policies that are flexible enough to support business operations but strict enough to protect sensitive data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To strike this balance, businesses should regularly review access permissions and update them as necessary. Employees may change roles, new threats may emerge, and regulatory requirements can shift. Periodic audits ensure that access remains aligned with the company's needs and security standards."

        "\n",
        "Data security is the cornerstone of any effective data governance strategy. It involves protecting data from unauthorized access, ensuring its integrity, and maintaining confidentiality across all systems and platforms. With businesses increasingly relying on cloud services, remote work, and extensive data sharing, robust security measures are essential to protect against breaches, leaks, and other vulnerabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll explore some of the key **security requirements** that businesses need to implement. We'll use examples from Nintendo world businesses to illustrate concepts like **data encryption**, **secure data transmission**, and **data masking** or **de-identification**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Encryption: Locking Down Sensitive Information\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data encryption** is the process of converting data into a coded format that can only be read by someone who has the decryption key. It's one of the most effective ways to protect sensitive information both at rest (when stored) and in transit (when being transferred across networks).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, Princess Peach's catering business stores customer payment details and event preferences in a Postgres database. To ensure this data remains safe from hackers, the business encrypts it both at rest (in the database) and when it is transmitted to Peach's suppliers. This way, even if the data is intercepted during transmission or accessed by unauthorized individuals, it will be unreadable without the proper decryption keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encryption can be implemented at different levels:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Database Encryption**: Encrypts entire databases or specific tables, such as customer payment data.\n",
        "-   **File Encryption**: Secures files that are stored on local drives, shared networks, or in the cloud.\n",
        "-   **Network Encryption**: Encrypts data as it moves between systems, such as during online transactions or email communications.\n",
        "\n",
        "By encrypting data, businesses can significantly reduce the risk of sensitive information being compromised, ensuring that even if someone gains access to the data, it remains unusable without the decryption key.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Transmission: Keeping Data Safe in Transit\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as important as protecting data at rest is securing it during transmission. **Secure data transmission** involves encrypting data as it moves from one location to another, preventing unauthorized access during the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider Donkey Kong's banana export business. To communicate with international partners and share shipment details, the company transmits sensitive pricing and contract information over the internet. If these communications were sent without security measures, they could be intercepted by hackers. To prevent this, Donkey Kong's team uses **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** and **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocols to encrypt all transmitted data. These protocols establish secure communication channels that protect data as it travels across networks, ensuring that only the intended recipients can access it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Masking and De-Identification: Protecting Privacy\n",
        "\n",
        "In many industries, particularly those dealing with personal health or financial information, it is necessary to protect the identity of individuals when using or sharing data. This is where **data masking** and **de-identification** come into play. **Data masking** refers to the process of hiding sensitive information by replacing it with fictitious data, while **de-identification** involves removing or altering personally identifiable information (PII) so that it cannot be linked back to an individual.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose Zelda runs the royal archives in Hyrule and is tasked with conducting a study on health trends among her citizens. She needs to share health data with researchers, but it's critical that individual identities remain protected. To accomplish this, Zelda's team de-identifies the data by removing names, addresses, and other personal information. They also use data masking techniques to scramble sensitive data fields, such as birthdates or medical conditions, ensuring that no unauthorized party can trace the data back to specific individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data masking and de-identification are particularly important for ensuring compliance with regulations like the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** in the U.S. or the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** in the EU, both of which mandate strict guidelines for protecting personal information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Security Best Practices for Data Governance\n",
        "\n",
        "To effectively protect their data, businesses need to adopt a range of security measures. These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires users to verify their identity using multiple forms of authentication (e.g., a password and a fingerprint) before accessing sensitive systems.\n",
        "-   **Data Backup and Recovery**: Ensures that data is regularly backed up and can be restored in the event of a breach, hardware failure, or other incident.\n",
        "-   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitors networks and systems for suspicious activity and alerts administrators to potential breaches.\n",
        "-   **Patch Management**: Regularly updates systems and software to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.\n",

        "\n",
        "Storing data securely and efficiently is a critical part of data governance. Businesses must decide where and how to store their data, weighing the advantages and limitations of **local storage**, **shared drives**, and **cloud-based storage** solutions. These decisions directly impact data security, accessibility, scalability, and compliance with regulatory standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll explore the strengths and weaknesses of different storage environments using examples from Nintendo world businesses, offering practical insights into how companies can choose the best storage solution for their needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Local Storage: Keeping Data In-House\n",
        "\n",
        "**Local storage** refers to the practice of storing data on physical devices within a company's premises. This could include servers, desktop computers, or external hard drives. Local storage gives businesses complete control over their data and how it's accessed, but it also comes with certain challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider Mario's plumbing business, which initially stores all customer records, billing information, and job schedules on a local server in their office. This local setup gives Mario and his team full control over their data. However, it also means they are solely responsible for maintaining the hardware, ensuring backups, and protecting the data from physical risks like fire or theft.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of Local Storage:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Control**: The business maintains full ownership and control of its data.\n",
        "-   **Security**: Local storage can be highly secure if appropriate physical and digital security measures are in place (e.g., locked server rooms, encrypted disks).\n",
        "-   **Offline Access**: Data can be accessed even without an internet connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages of Local Storage:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Scalability**: Expanding local storage can be expensive and physically demanding, requiring new hardware and increased maintenance.\n",
        "-   **Data Backup and Recovery**: If a local server fails or data is corrupted, recovery can be difficult without proper backup protocols.\n",
        "-   **Limited Access**: Accessing data remotely can be challenging, especially if the system isn't set up for remote connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Mario's business, while local storage provides a sense of security and simplicity during the early stages, as the business grows, the limitations of local storage may become a barrier to efficiency and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Shared Drive Storage: Balancing Collaboration and Control\n",
        "\n",
        "**Shared drives** provide a middle ground between local and cloud storage, offering collaboration capabilities while keeping data within a company's control. Shared drives are often hosted on a company's internal network or an external server, allowing multiple users to access the same data from different locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, Bowser's villain consulting firm uses a shared drive to store contracts, research data, and client documents. Employees across various departments can collaborate on projects and access shared resources without needing cloud infrastructure. However, shared drives are still subject to many of the same challenges as local storage, including hardware failures and physical security risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of Shared Drives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Collaboration**: Multiple users can access and work on the same files, making it ideal for team projects.\n",
        "-   **Control**: Like local storage, businesses maintain control over the data, though it's shared across more users.\n",
        "-   **Internal Access**: Data remains accessible within the company's network, reducing reliance on third-party services.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages of Shared Drives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Limited Remote Access**: Shared drives are often restricted to the company's network, making remote access challenging without a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n",
        "-   **Security Risks**: If not properly managed, shared drives can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users within the organization.\n",
        "-   **Maintenance Overhead**: IT teams must still manage hardware, software, and backups to ensure the system remains operational.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Bowser's business, shared drives offer a collaborative solution but come with the trade-off of increased complexity in access control and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cloud-Based Storage: Flexibility and Scalability in the Cloud\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cloud-based storage** allows businesses to store their data on remote servers managed by third-party providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. The data is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, offering unparalleled scalability and flexibility. For many businesses, cloud storage has become the go-to solution for handling large amounts of data, offering robust backup and recovery options as well as built-in security measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Donkey Kong's banana export business, for instance, relies on a cloud-based storage system to manage its global operations. Shipment details, customer orders, and financial records are stored in the cloud, allowing Donkey Kong and his team to access real-time information from anywhere in the world. This ensures that no matter where they are, the team can respond quickly to changes in the supply chain, whether it's a delayed shipment or a new contract.\n",

        "### Data Processing Guidelines\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data processing** refers to the various operations performed on data, including collection, storage, transformation, and analysis. Establishing clear **data processing guidelines** is crucial for ensuring that data is handled consistently and securely throughout its lifecycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Donkey Kong's banana export business, for example, the data processing pipeline involves collecting data on shipments, processing that data to generate forecasts, and storing the results for future analysis. Each step in this process must be carefully controlled to ensure data integrity and quality. Donkey Kong's data processing guidelines might include rules about how raw data is collected (e.g., direct from suppliers), how it is transformed (e.g., removing duplicates, formatting correctly), and how processed data is stored and accessed by the team.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key principles of data processing include:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Minimization**: Only process the data that is absolutely necessary for the task at hand.\n",
        "-   **Accuracy**: Ensure that data is accurate and up-to-date throughout the processing pipeline.\n",
        "-   **Transparency**: Document the steps involved in data processing so that they can be reviewed and audited.\n",
        "-   **Security**: Protect data at every stage of processing, ensuring it remains confidential and secure.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following these guidelines, businesses like Donkey Kong's can avoid common pitfalls such as data corruption or unauthorized access during processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Retention\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data retention** refers to the policies and practices surrounding how long data is kept within an organization before it is archived or deleted. Retention policies are often influenced by legal requirements, such as tax laws or industry regulations, as well as internal business needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, Bowser's villain consulting firm might have a policy that requires retaining financial records for a minimum of seven years to comply with tax regulations. At the same time, the firm might only keep customer engagement data for two years to reduce storage costs and mitigate security risks. Balancing these competing requirements is key to effective data retention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common factors to consider when establishing data retention policies:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Legal Obligations**: Laws and regulations may require certain types of data to be retained for specific periods.\n",
        "-   **Business Needs**: Some data, such as customer records or financial reports, may need to be retained for operational purposes.\n",
        "-   **Cost of Storage**: Storing data can be expensive, so businesses need to evaluate whether keeping certain data is worth the cost.\n",
        "-   **Security and Risk**: The longer data is stored, the greater the risk of it being compromised in a breach. Minimizing retention reduces exposure to these risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "By adhering to a well-designed retention policy, businesses like Bowser's consulting firm can reduce both their storage costs and their security risks, while remaining compliant with legal obligations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Deletion\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data deletion** involves the safe and secure removal of data from an organization's systems. Data deletion must be done in accordance with both internal policies and external regulations to ensure that sensitive information is properly disposed of and cannot be recovered by unauthorized parties.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Zelda's royal archives, for example, when old event records or personal information are no longer needed, they must be deleted in a way that ensures they cannot be retrieved. This might involve securely wiping hard drives, using software tools to permanently delete files, or shredding paper records.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data deletion should follow these best practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Permanent Erasure**: Ensure that deleted data is permanently erased and cannot be restored.\n",
        "-   **Compliance**: Deletion practices must align with regulatory requirements, such as GDPR's \"right to be forgotten.\"\n",
        "-   **Documented Procedures**: The deletion process should be well-documented and regularly reviewed to ensure compliance and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following secure deletion protocols helps businesses like Zelda's protect their data and remain compliant with legal requirements around data privacy and security."

        "\n",
        "At the core of any relational database lies the careful organization of data into entities and their relationships. These **entity relationships** ensure that data is stored in a consistent, organized manner, allowing it to be efficiently queried, analyzed, and maintained. In this section, we will explore the critical components of entity relationship requirements: **record link restrictions**, **data constraints**, and **cardinality**. These concepts help ensure that data maintains its integrity within a system like Postgres, which we'll explore through examples from Nintendo world businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Record Link Restrictions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Record link restrictions** define how entities in a database are connected or related. In a relational database, entities---such as customers, orders, or products---are stored in separate tables. The relationships between these entities are defined through **foreign keys**, which link records in one table to corresponding records in another. These links must be carefully controlled to ensure that data integrity is maintained.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider Mario's plumbing business. In his Postgres database, Mario stores customer information in one table and job orders in another. Each job order must be linked to a specific customer, ensuring that every service performed can be traced back to the correct individual. To enforce this relationship, Mario uses a foreign key in the job orders table that links to the customer ID in the customers table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without proper record link restrictions, issues like orphaned records (where a job order exists without a corresponding customer) can arise. This could lead to confusion, errors in billing, and difficulty tracking customer history.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example: Foreign Key Constraint in Mario's Database**\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
        "    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
        "    address VARCHAR(255)\n",
        ");\n",
        "\n",
        "CREATE TABLE job_orders (\n",

        "    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id),\n",
        "    service_description VARCHAR(255),\n",
        "    date DATE\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this setup, the `customer_id` column in the `job_orders` table is a foreign key that ensures each job is correctly linked to a customer in the `customers` table.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data constraints** are rules that ensure data stored in the database meets certain conditions or standards. These constraints help prevent invalid or incorrect data from being entered into the system, preserving data quality and consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in Princess Peach's catering business, the database might include constraints to ensure that certain fields---such as event dates and guest numbers---are always filled in correctly. Peach's team might use **NOT NULL** constraints to ensure that no event is scheduled without a date, and **CHECK** constraints to make sure the number of guests is always a positive number.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common Data Constraints Include:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **NOT NULL**: Ensures that a field cannot be left empty.\n",
        "-   **UNIQUE**: Guarantees that each value in a field is unique across the table.\n",
        "-   **CHECK**: Enforces conditions on data (e.g., ensuring values fall within a specified range).\n",
        "-   **DEFAULT**: Provides a default value for a field when no value is specified.\n",
        "-   **FOREIGN KEY**: Enforces relationships between tables, as discussed in record link restrictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example: Data Constraints in Princess Peach's Catering Database**\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",

        "    guest_count INT CHECK (guest_count > 0)\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `event_name` and `event_date` fields cannot be null, ensuring that every event has a name and a scheduled date. Additionally, the `guest_count` field must always be greater than zero, preventing invalid entries like negative guest numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cardinality: Defining the Relationships\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cardinality** defines the nature of relationships between entities---whether a relationship is **one-to-one**, **one-to-many**, or **many-to-many**. These relationships dictate how data is structured within a database and how entities interact with one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Bowser's villain consulting firm, for example, each client might be linked to multiple consulting engagements. This is a **one-to-many** relationship, where one client can have multiple engagements, but each engagement is tied to only one client. On the other hand, if each engagement involved multiple consultants working together, you would have a **many-to-many** relationship, where multiple consultants could be linked to multiple engagements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding and defining cardinality is essential for maintaining the integrity of a relational database and ensuring that queries return accurate and meaningful results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Types of Cardinality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **One-to-One**: Each record in Table A is linked to one (and only one) record in Table B.\n",
        "-   **One-to-Many**: Each record in Table A is linked to multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B is linked to only one record in Table A.\n",
        "-   **Many-to-Many**: Records in Table A are linked to multiple records in Table B, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example: One-to-Many Relationship in Bowser's Consulting Database**\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE clients (\n",
        "    client_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    client_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL\n",
        ");\n",

        "    engagement_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    client_id INT REFERENCES clients(client_id),\n",
        "    engagement_details VARCHAR(255)\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
