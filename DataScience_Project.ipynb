        "1. Create three different visualizations that best represent your data and help answer your research questions.\n",

        "### Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "- Choose the right type of plot for your data and what you want to show.\n",
        "- Use color effectively, but don't overdo it.\n",
        "- Label your axes and include a title that explains what the visualization shows.\n",
        "- If using multiple categories, consider using a legend.\n",
        "- Pay attention to scale and consider if you need to normalize your data.\n",
        "- Don't try to put too much information in a single visualization.\n",

        "### Justification\n",
        "\n",
        "For each visualization:\n",
        "1. Explain why you chose this type of plot for your data.\n",
        "2. Describe what the visualization reveals about your data.\n",
        "3. Discuss how this visualization helps answer one of your research questions or provides insight into your dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, the goal is not just to make your data look pretty, but to communicate information effectively. Your choice of visualization should help the viewer understand your data and your findings more easily."
