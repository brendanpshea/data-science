# Data Science: A Practical and Philosophical Introduction
### Brendan Shea, PHD

Welcome to **Data Science: A Practical and Philosophical Introduction**, an open-access textbook designed to teach the fundamentals of data science through a hands-on, practical approach combined with philosophical insights. The textbook includes Jupyter notebooks with interactive exercises, real-world data examples, and practical tools like SQL, Python, and statistical libraries.

## Chapters

An engaging example using **Minecraft-inspired data**. In this chapter, you will practice data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using Python tools like **SQLite** and **Pandas**. You'll build a small SQLite database with village data, preparing it for future analysis.

### 4. Data Cleaning
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_04_DataCleaning.ipynb)  
In this chapter, you’ll delve into data cleaning techniques, including handling missing data, detecting outliers, and ensuring data consistency. You'll work with **real-world datasets**, such as survey responses, and use **Pandas** for transforming messy data into a clean, usable form.

### 5. Write Better Queries
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_05_WriteBetterQueries.ipynb)  
Learn how to write efficient SQL queries to access and manipulate relational databases. You'll use **SQLite** to practice your query writing skills on datasets such as **movie databases** and learn how to optimize performance for large datasets.

### 6. Descriptive Statistics
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_06_DescriptiveStatistics.ipynb)  
This chapter covers the fundamentals of descriptive statistics. You'll use Python libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** to calculate measures of central tendency and variability. The examples include data from **weather observations** and **student test scores**.

### 7. Inferential Statistics
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_07_InferentialStats.ipynb)  
Dive into inferential statistics, learning about **hypothesis testing**, confidence intervals, and statistical tests such as t-tests and chi-squared tests. You'll apply these concepts to data such as **medical trial results** and **election polling data**, using **SciPy** and **Statsmodels**.

### 8. Analysis
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_08_Analysis.ipynb)  
In this chapter, you’ll analyze datasets using techniques such as **linear regression**, **correlation analysis**, and **classification**. The examples focus on **economic data** and **sports analytics**, using tools such as **Pandas**, **Statsmodels**, and **Scikit-learn**.

### 9. Reports
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_09_Reports.ipynb)  
This chapter explores the best practices for creating professional reports. You'll learn how to use **Markdown**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and **LaTeX** to format and present your analysis effectively. Examples include preparing reports on **company sales data**.

### 10. Data Dashboards
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_10_DataDashboards.ipynb)  
Learn to create interactive **data dashboards** using **Dash** and **Plotly**. In this chapter, you’ll build a simple dashboard that visualizes data from a **fictional retail company**, allowing users to interact with the data and generate custom views.

### 11. Data Governance
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/brendanpshea/data-science/blob/main/DataScience_11_DataGovernance.ipynb)  
This chapter covers the critical topic of **data governance**, including issues related to data privacy, ethics, and compliance. You'll explore real-world examples of data governance challenges faced by by a fictional DNA testing company (set int the world of the X-men) using a **Postgres** database.

**A Note on the Use of AI Tools.** These chapters were intitially developed as the “generative AI” explosion took off (staring with OpenAI’s GPT 3.0), and I’ve had fun experimenting with many of these tools—including successive versions of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, Mistral, CoPilot, and others—in helping to turn my (voluminous, but often unorganized) lecture notes into something resembling a proper book. My experience was these tools with these has been generally positive, and I think that they can someday do at least some of the work done by traditional editors and publishing houses (I say this as a former editor at an academic press!). I’m less convinced they are going to immediately replace the actual *writer* or *programmer*, though, as there’s still a fair amount of expertise (and effort!) into producing quality, meaningful output.
