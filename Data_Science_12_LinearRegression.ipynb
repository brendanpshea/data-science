        "# Chapter: An Introduction to Linear Regression Using Boston Housing Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the world of **linear regression**, a fundamental concept in the realm of data science and statistics! Imagine you're a detective trying to unravel mysteries hidden within numbers. Linear regression is one of your most reliable tools in this quest.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we'll explore linear regression using a real-world dataset: the **Boston Housing Dataset**. This dataset, like a treasure map, contains information about various houses in Boston, including their price, the number of rooms, age, and more. By analyzing this data, we can start to understand the relationship between these features and how they affect house prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, **linear regression** is a way to predict a value based on one or more input values. Think of it like trying to draw a straight line through a set of points on a graph so that the line is as close as possible to all the points. This line helps us understand relationships between variables. For example, how does the size of a house (measured in rooms) relate to its price?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **Dependent Variable** is what we want to predict. In our case, it's the house price.\n",
        "- **Independent Variables** are the factors we think might affect our dependent variable. For the Boston Housing data, this could be things like the number of rooms, age of the house, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll be using a Python library called **StatsModel** to perform our linear regression analysis. StatsModel is a powerful tool that makes it easier to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "After we've created our model, we'll want to know how good it is. For this, we use model metrics like:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **R-squared** tells us how well our line fits the data. A higher R-squared value means a better fit.\n",
        "- The **Coefficients** numbers tell us how much our dependent variable (house price) changes with a one-unit change in our independent variables (like the number of rooms).\n",
        "\n",
        "Some questions we'll be exploring include the following:\n",
        "1. How does the number of rooms in a house relate to its price?\n",
        "2. Are there any surprising factors that affect the price of a house in Boston?\n",
        "3. How well does our linear regression model predict house prices?\n",
        "4. What does the R-squared value tell us about our model?\n",
        "5. How can we interpret the coefficients of our model in the context of house pricing?\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you'll not only understand the basics of linear regression but also how to apply it to real-world data. Let's dive in and uncover the stories hidden in the Boston Housing dataset!\n"

        "## Loading and Explroring Boston Housing Data\n",
        "To start, let's load the Boston housing data and take a look at it. A quick look at the data dictionary (available many places online) reveals that the columns are:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "PRICE - The price of the house.\n",
        "CRIM - per capita crime rate by town\n",
        "ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
        "INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n",
        "CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n",
        "NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million). Historically, this has often been used as a target variable.\n",
        "RM - average number of rooms per dwelling\n",
        "AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n",
        "DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n",
        "RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways\n",
        "TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000\n",
        "PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town\n",
        "B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town\n",
        "LSTAT - % lower status of the population\n",
        "MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's. This is our \"target' variable.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, our task will be to predict house price based on some of these other variables."

        "Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The \"linear\" in linear regression refers to the fact that this relationship takes the form of a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "In its simplest form, with one independent variable, the linear regression model can be represented as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\epsilon $$\n",

        "- $x$ is the independent variable we're using for prediction.\n",
        "- $\\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the regression line.\n",
        "- $\\beta_1$ represents the slope of the regression line, indicating how much \\( y \\) changes for a unit change in \\( x \\).\n",
        "- $\\epsilon$ represents the error term, accounting for the variability in \\( y \\) that cannot be explained by \\( x \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression can help us to do two important things:\n",
        "1. We can **predit outcomes** when you have a continuous outcome variable (like house prices, temperatures, etc.) and one or more predictor variables.\n",
        "2. We can use linear regression to **explain** and understand the strength and direction (positive or negative) of the relationship between variables.\n",
