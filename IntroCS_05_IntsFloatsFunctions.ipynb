        "# Python: Data Types and Functions\n",
        "## Brendan Shea, PhD (Brendan.Shea@rctc.edu)\n",
        "\n",
        " In this lesson, we will explore the concept of \"data types\" and \"functions\" using Python as an example. Data types are an essential building block in programming, as they help us understand and organize the different kinds of information our code will work with. Don't worry if you're new to programming; we'll start with the basics.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we've discussed earlier, Python is a popular, user-friendly programming language known for its simplicity and readability. One of its key features is that it is **dynamically typed.** This means that Python automatically identifies the type of data you're working with, making it easier for beginners to start coding without worrying about specifying data types beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, some common data types are:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Data Type | Description | Example |\n",
        "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
        "| Integer (`int`) | A whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length. | `x = 10` |\n",
        "| Float (`float`) | A number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. | `y = 7.5` |\n",
        "| String (`str`) | A sequence of Unicode characters. Enclosed in either single quotes or double quotes. | `name = \"John\"` |\n",
        "| Boolean (`bool`) | Data type with two built-in values: `True` or `False`. | `is_true = False` |\n",
        "| List (`list`) | A collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. | `fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` |\n",
        "| Tuple (`tuple`) | A collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. | `colors = ('red', 'blue', 'green')` |\n",
        "| Set (`set`) | A collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members. | `cars = {'Toyota', 'Ford', 'Tesla'}` |\n",
        "| Dictionary (`dict`) | A collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members. It's a key-value pair. | `student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 20}` |\n",
        "| None (`NoneType`) | A special data type representing the absence of a value or a null value. | `x = None` |\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As Python is dynamically typed, you don't need to explicitly specify the data type when creating a variable. For example, to assign the integer value 5 to a variable named 'x', you can simply write: `x = 5`\n",
        "\n",
        "Python will understand that 'x' is an integer, and store it accordingly. This flexibility makes Python more convenient for beginners, as you can focus on learning programming concepts without getting bogged down in the details of data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Integers\n",
        "An integer is a whole number, which means it doesn't have any decimal places. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero. In Python, integers are one of the basic data types that you can use to represent and work with numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some examples of integers:\n",
        "```\n",
        "0\n",
        "42\n",
        "-7\n",
        "1234\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use integers to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Python also provides some additional operations that are specifically designed to work with integers, like floor division and modulus.\n",

        "Rubber duck debugging is a method where you explain your code line by line to a rubber duck (or any other inanimate object) as if you're teaching it how the code works. The act of verbalizing your thought process and explaining the code out loud can help you discover issues or inconsistencies you didn't notice before.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use rubber duck debugging effectively, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Place a rubber duck (or any object) on your desk or near your computer.\n",
        "2. Start at the beginning of your code and explain each line or block of code in detail.\n",
        "3. For each line, describe the purpose of the code, what it's doing, and the expected outcome.\n",
        "4. As you explain your code, pay close attention to any assumptions you're making or any parts that feel unclear or confusing.\n",
        "5. Breaking your code into discrete functions (and using Jupyter Notebook cells) can make rubber duck debugging more effective. By focusing on one function or cell at a time, you can dive deep into the logic of your code and identify issues more easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that different debugging techniques work better for different situations and personal preferences. Start with these three methods, and as you gain experience, you can explore other debugging techniques that suit your needs."
