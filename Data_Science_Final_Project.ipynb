        "Begin your data science exploration by selecting and loading a dataset from the `pydataset` library. The choice of dataset is crucial as it forms the basis of your analysis. Consider the dataset's size, complexity, and relevance to your interests. Once selected, use Python to load the dataset. Investigate its origin: who created the dataset, what was its purpose, and what context does it represent? This understanding is essential for a meaningful analysis. Describe the dataset's contents, including what each column represents, to provide a clear overview of the data you will be working with.\n",

        "After conducting the hypothesis test, the next step is to interpret the results. This involves understanding the p-value and test statistic in the context of your chosen significance level and what they imply about your hypothesis. For instance, a p-value lower than your significance level suggests that you can reject the null hypothesis. Explain what this conclusion means in the context of your dataset and the real-world phenomenon it represents. Does it support or refute your initial hypothesis? Reflect on the implications of your findings and any limitations of your testing approach."

When analyzing the data, think about potential harms that could arise from your analysis or the conclusions you draw.
