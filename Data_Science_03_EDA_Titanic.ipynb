        "# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic\n",
        "This chapter will delve deeper into the exciting world of data science by focusing on the crucial step of exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is a fundamental part of any data science project, allowing us to understand the data we're working with and make informed decisions about how to proceed with our analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we'll be learning how to handle common challenges that arise when dealing with real-world data, such as missing data, outliers, and inconsistent data entries. Understanding and addressing these issues is vital for ensuring the reliability and validity of our analysis. We'll learn about various techniques for identifying and handling these issues, and apply them to a real dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Speaking of datasets, the one we'll be using throughout this notebook is the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset in the data science world. This dataset contains passenger information from the infamous Titanic ship that sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg. The data includes various details about each passenger, such as their age, sex, passenger class, fare, and most notably, whether or not they survived the sinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to these practical skills, we'll also delve into data science's philosophical side. Specifically, we'll discuss the \"problem of induction,\" a philosophical issue that deals with our ability to make generalizations or predictions based on specific observations. This issue is particularly relevant to data science, where we often need to make general predictions based on specific datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, you will better understand the steps involved in preparing a dataset for analysis, and you will be more aware of the philosophical considerations underpinning our work as data scientists. So, let's dive in and get started!"

        "\n",
        "-   `Survived:` This is our target variable, which we would like to predict if we were building a machine learning model. It indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Pclass:` This refers to the passenger's ticket class, a proxy for socio-economic status. It's an ordinal integer feature where 1 = 1st class (Upper), 2 = 2nd class (Middle), and 3 = 3rd class (Lower).\n",

        "-   `Name:` The name of the passenger.\n",

        "-   `SibSp:` This is the number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Parch:` This is the number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `Ticket:` This is the ticket number of the passenger.\n",
        "\n",

It's a chance to roll up your sleeves and get hands-on with your data. So, let's understand a bit more about what EDA is and why it's important.\n",

        "EDA is the practice of using visual and quantitative methods to understand and summarize a dataset without making any assumptions about its contents. It's all about exploring and it's the first step in your data analysis process. In EDA, we try to understand the patterns and relationships in our data, often by using visual methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The importance of EDA cannot be overstated. It enables us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Identify patterns and relationships in the data, which could lead to hypotheses for later testing.\n",

        "\n",
        "To explore our data, we'll be asking a series of questions and seeking their answers by using a variety of statistical and visualization techniques. However, remember that EDA is not a rigid process. It's more of a creative and iterative process, allowing you to dig deeper as you uncover more about your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, while EDA helps us to understand the data's underlying structure and extract valuable insights, it's important to note that EDA doesn't directly involve making predictions or testing hypotheses. It simply helps us to comprehend the data better and guides us in building suitable predictive models or conducting statistical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, we'll dive right into EDA, using our Titanic dataset to guide us. We'll be addressing some key questions to help you understand basic concepts and techniques of data cleaning and EDA. By the end, you'll have a solid grasp of this critical phase of the data science process, and be well-equipped to tackle your own data exploration in the future. Let's get started!"

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The task of handling missing values is an essential step in the data cleaning process. Data can be missing for various reasons: maybe an individual chose not to share their age, a technical glitch didn't record the cabin number, or perhaps the port of embarkation data was lost. Whatever the reason, our task is to make a strategic choice about how to handle these gaps in our dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three fundamental strategies for handling missing data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Imputation:** This strategy involves filling missing data with some value. The choice of value can significantly affect our analysis, and it usually depends on the nature of our data. Common choices are:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Mean:** The mean or average is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. It works well when the data is normally distributed, but it can be misleading if there are outliers in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Median:** The median is the middle value in a dataset. It separates the data into two halves and is less affected by outliers and skewed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **Mode:** The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is often used for categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Deletion:** In this strategy, we remove the rows or columns with missing values. This is usually done when the number of missing values is relatively small, and removing them would not cause significant loss of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Prediction:** Advanced methods involve predicting missing values, using machine learning algorithms or other techniques. However, for our beginner's guide, we will stick to imputation and deletion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's address the missing values in our data:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Age: The 'Age' column is numerical data. It may contain outliers (for instance, a few very old passengers). Thus, using the median might be a good choice here as it is less sensitive to extreme values compared to the mean. We can use the Pandas method `fillna()` to fill the missing values. Here `inplace=True` indicates that changes are to be made directly to our DataFrame."

        "\n",
        "When we work with a dataset, especially one with many columns like the Titanic dataset, we often don't need to use every single column for our analysis. Feature selection, or choosing which features (columns) to include in our analysis, is a critical step in the data cleaning and preparation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The features that we include will depend on what sort of question(s) we are interested in answering. For example, suppose we are interested in the research question, **\"How did age, gender, and passenger class affect survival on the Titanic?\".**  This questions is interesting for several reasoning, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The sinking of the Titanic is a significant event in history, and understanding the factors that influenced survival can shed light on societal norms of that era, like \"women and children first.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The factors influencing survival in a disaster like the sinking of the Titanic could offer insights applicable to emergency planning and response today.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. This question also provides a fantastic opportunity to learn and practice data cleaning, EDA, and data analysis techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "To answer this question, the 'Age', 'Sex', 'Pclass', and 'Survived' columns are particularly relevant:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Age:** Age could have been a factor in survival – perhaps younger or older individuals were less likely to survive.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sex:** It's often said that in maritime disasters, the protocol was \"women and children first\" for lifeboats. The 'Sex' column can help us investigate whether this was indeed the case on the Titanic.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pclass:** The 'Pclass' (passenger class) column can indicate socioeconomic status. First-class passengers had cabins closer to the deck and might have had better access to lifeboats, possibly influencing survival chances.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Survived:** Obviously, to understand what factors influenced survival, we need to know who survived and who didn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
