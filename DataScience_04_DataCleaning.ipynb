        "# From Messy to Meaningful: Mastering the Art of Data Cleaning\n",
        "### Data Science:  A Practical and Philosophical Introduction | Brendan Shea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "The journey from raw data to actionable insights is fraught with challenges. At the core of this journey lies a critical, often underappreciated process: data cleaning. Also known as data cleansing or scrubbing, this fundamental step transforms chaotic, error-prone datasets into reliable foundations for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data cleaning is not merely about tidying up; it's about ensuring the integrity and validity of your entire analytical process. Consider a dataset of high school sports statistics. At first glance, it might seem like a goldmine of information: player performance metrics, team records, and game results. However, lurking beneath the surface are potential pitfalls that could derail even the most sophisticated analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Duplicate Entries--A star player's 30-goal season accidentally recorded twice, inflating their stats to an impossible 60 goals.\n",
        "2.  Missing Values--Half the forwards missing assist data, making fair comparisons impossible.\n",
        "3.  Inconsistent Formats--\"Soccersaurus Rex\" and \"Soccer-saurus Rex\" recorded as different teams, fragmenting their data.\n",
        "4.  Outliers--A goalkeeper with 50 goals, challenging the bounds of plausibility.\n",
        "5.  Data Type Mismatches--Goals recorded as text instead of numbers, preventing proper statistical analysis.\n",
        "6.  Standardization Issues--Heights recorded in a mix of feet, inches, and centimeters.\n",
        "\n",
        "These issues are not unique to sports analytics. Whether you're working in finance, healthcare, marketing, or any other data-rich field, the challenges of \"dirty\" data are universal. Left unaddressed, they can lead to flawed analyses, misguided decisions, and missed opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we'll dive deep into the world of data cleaning, using a high school sports dataset as our illustrative playground. We'll explore a comprehensive range of data quality issues and learn techniques to transform messy data into a robust foundation for analysis. You'll discover how to leverage both SQL and Python's Pandas library to tackle these challenges, giving you a versatile toolkit for data cleaning across various scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll start by examining the anatomy of dirty data, learning to identify common issues that plague datasets across industries. From there, we'll explore the data cleaning process step-by-step, covering techniques such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Handling missing data through imputation and deletion strategies\n",
        "-   Identifying and removing duplicate records\n",
        "-   Standardizing inconsistent data formats and units\n",
        "-   Dealing with outliers through detection and treatment methods\n",
        "-   Correcting data type mismatches and parsing errors\n",
        "-   Normalizing and scaling data for consistency\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the chapter, we'll compare and contrast two primary approaches to data cleaning: the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process typically associated with Python and Pandas, and the Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) process often used with SQL in database environments. You'll gain hands-on experience with both methods, learning when and why to choose one over the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning Outcomes: By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Identify and categorize common types of data quality issues in diverse datasets.\n",
        "2.  Apply a wide range of SQL techniques for data cleaning in an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflow.\n",
        "3.  Utilize Python's Pandas library for comprehensive data cleaning in an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.\n",
        "4.  Transform raw, messy data into clean, analysis-ready datasets using both programmatic and visual inspection methods.\n",
        "5.  Compare and contrast ETL and ELT approaches, understanding their respective strengths and appropriate use cases.\n",
        "6.  Implement various data cleaning strategies including handling missing values, correcting data types, and normalizing data.\n",
        "7.  Detect and handle outliers using statistical methods and domain knowledge.\n",
        "8.  Standardize inconsistent data formats and units across large datasets.\n",
        "9.  Create documented, reproducible data cleaning pipelines for ensuring data quality in ongoing projects.\n",
        "\n",

        "3.  We're using four standard soccer positions.\n",
        "4.  The script creates 200 rows of data, randomly assigning players to teams and positions, and generating plausible statistics for goals, assists, and saves.\n",
        "5.  *Intentional Issues*. With a 10% probability, the script introduces one of four types of data quality problems:\n",
        "    -   **Duplicates**: Identical rows are added.\n",
        "    -   **Missing Values**: The 'Assists' field is set to NaN (Not a Number).\n",
        "    -   **Invalid Data**: An non-existent position \"Striker\" is used instead of the valid positions.\n",
        "    -   **Outliers**: Unrealistically high values are set for goals, assists, and saves.\n",
        "    - **Negative values.** We have inappropriate negative values.\n",
        "    - **Type errors**. Some data (that should be numeric) is instead a string.\n",

Then, we'll show how we could do the same thing using a Python and the Pandas library (a common practice if one is using Extract-Transform-Load).

It allows you to create conditions and return different values based on whether those conditions are met. The basic syntax of a `CASE` statement is:\n",

        "```\n",

        "-   `WHEN` specifies a condition to evaluate.\n",
        "-   `THEN` specifies the result to return if the condition is true.\n",
        "-   `ELSE` Specifies the result to return if none of the conditions are true (optional).\n",
        "-   `END` Marks the end of the `CASE` statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's look at how the `CASE` statement is used in the provided query to count `NULL` values in each column.\n",

        "\n",
        "    This `CASE` statement is nested inside the `COUNT` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  `COUNT(CASE ... END)`: The `COUNT` function counts the number of non-`NULL` values returned by the `CASE` statement. Since the `CASE` statement only returns `1` for `NULL` values, `COUNT` effectively counts the number of `NULL` values in the column.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The same logic applies to the other columns (`Player`, `Position`, `Goals`, `Assists`, and `Saves`), each using a similar `CASE` statement to count `NULL` values."

        "| Term | Definition |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| CASE | In the SQL query `SELECT ____ WHEN condition THEN result END FROM table`, this keyword introduces a conditional expression. It allows for different results based on specified conditions within a single query. |\n",
        "| Data cleaning | The process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets. Essential for ensuring data quality and reliability in analysis. |\n",
        "| (Data) Blend | The process of combining data from different sources or formats, often involving more complex integration than simple merging or concatenation. Allows for comprehensive analysis across diverse data sources. |\n",
        "| (Data) Concatenate | The process of combining datasets vertically, adding rows rather than columns. Useful for aggregating data from multiple periods or sources into a single dataset. |\n",
        "| (Data) Merge | The process of combining data from multiple tables or datasets based on a common field. Essential for integrating information from different sources in relational databases. |\n",
        "| Data type validation | The process of ensuring each column contains the expected type of data (e.g., integers for numerical fields, text for names). Critical for preventing errors in data manipulation and analysis. |\n",
        "| Derived variable | A new data point created from existing data through calculation or transformation. Can provide new insights or simplify complex relationships in the data. |\n",
        "| Duplicate data | Identical or very similar records that appear multiple times in a dataset. Can lead to overestimation of certain data points and skew analysis results. |\n",
        "| ELSE | In the SQL query `SELECT CASE WHEN condition THEN result ____ default END FROM table`, this keyword specifies the result to return if none of the WHEN conditions are true. It's optional but often used to handle all other cases in a CASE statement. |\n",
        "| END | In the SQL query `SELECT CASE WHEN condition THEN result ELSE default ____ FROM table`, this keyword marks the conclusion of a CASE statement. It ensures proper closure of the conditional logic block in the query. |\n",
        "| Imputation | The process of replacing missing data with substituted values. Aims to create a complete dataset for analysis while minimizing bias introduction. |\n",
        "| INNER JOIN | In the SQL query `SELECT * FROM table1 ____ table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`, this clause returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined. It's useful for finding records that satisfy conditions in multiple tables. |\n",
        "| Invalid data | Values that don't conform to the expected format or fall outside the realm of possibility for a given field. Can lead to errors in analysis or visualization if not addressed. |\n",
        "| LEFT JOIN | In the SQL query `SELECT * FROM table1 ____ table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`, this clause returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. It's useful when you want to keep all records from one table even if there are no matches in the other. |\n",
        "| LOCF | Last Observation Carried Forward, an imputation technique where missing values are filled with the last observed value in time series data. Assumes stability in values over time. |\n",
        "| Mean imputation | A method of imputation where missing values are replaced with the mean of the available data for that variable. Simple but can distort the distribution and underestimate variance. |\n",
        "| Median imputation | An imputation technique where missing values are replaced with the median of the available data. More robust to outliers than mean imputation, especially for skewed distributions. |\n",
        "| Mode imputation | An imputation method where missing values are replaced with the most frequent value (mode) of the variable. Commonly used for categorical data or discrete numerical data. |\n",
        "| Nonparametric data | Data that doesn't follow a specific probability distribution, often due to inconsistencies in data entry. Can lead to fragmentation of what should be unified categories, complicating analysis. |\n",
        "| Normalization | The process of adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale, typically between 0 and 1. Enables fair comparison between variables with different ranges or units. |\n",
        "| Null | A special marker in databases indicating the absence of a value or unknown information. Different from zero or an empty string, and requires special handling in queries and analysis. |\n",
        "| Outlier | A data point that differs significantly from other observations in a dataset. Can represent genuinely exceptional cases or indicate data entry errors, requiring careful examination. |\n",
        "| Recoding data | The process of changing values in a dataset, often to standardize or categorize data. Useful for creating meaningful groups or correcting inconsistencies in categorical data. |\n",
        "| Redundant data | Information that is repeated unnecessarily or can be derived from other data points. Increases storage requirements and can lead to inconsistencies if not managed properly. |\n",
        "| Regular expression | A sequence of characters defining a search pattern, often used for pattern matching with strings. Powerful tool for identifying and manipulating specific data patterns. |\n",
        "| Regression imputation | An imputation method that uses other variables to predict and impute missing values through regression analysis. Can preserve relationships between variables but may overstate correlations. |\n",
        "| RIGHT JOIN | In the SQL query `SELECT * FROM table1 ____ table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`, this clause returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table. It's similar to LEFT JOIN but with the tables' roles reversed. |\n",
