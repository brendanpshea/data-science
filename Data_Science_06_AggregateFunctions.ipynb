        "1.  BeerName: The name of the beer.\n",
        "2.  Brewery: The name of the brewery that produces the beer.\n",

        "4.  ABV (Alcohol By Volume): This represents the alcohol content in the beer, measured as a percentage. For example, a beer with an ABV of 9.2% contains 9.2% alcohol by volume.\n",
        "5.  NumRating: The number of ratings the beer has received on Beer Advocate, a popular beer rating website.\n",
        "6.  AvgRating: The average rating of the beer on a scale from 1 to 5, where a higher rating indicates a more favorable review.\n",

In Pandas, the `sort_values()` function is used to perform sorting on a Series or DataFrame. In our analysis of the Minnesota Beer data, we used the `sort_values()` function to organize data in a meaningful way. Here's a closer look at how we used this function:\n",
        "\n",

        "3.  Creating a New Copy: The `sort_values()` function returns a new sorted Series or DataFrame, leaving the original data unchanged. This allows us to maintain the original dataset while working with a sorted version.\n",

In the context of our beer analysis, the data frame we used earlier was obtained through web scraping from Beer Advocate's Top Rated Beers in Minnesota (https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/top-rated/us/mn/). This webpage provides a treasure trove of details on highly rated beers, including the beer's name, style, ABV (Alcohol By Volume), and average rating.\n",

Upon receiving the HTML content of the webpage from the server, data scientists use libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to parse the HTML content and navigate through the elements. By identifying specific HTML tags and attributes, they can extract the desired data, such as beer names, styles, and ratings. Once extracted, this data must be cleaned and structured into a usable format, such as a Pandas DataFrame, by removing unnecessary characters and whitespace.

Legal and ethical considerations must always be taken into account, as scraping might be restricted or prohibited by a website's terms of service. Additionally, the data on webpages may contain human errors or inconsistencies, leading to inaccuracies in the scraped information. Websites might also implement rate limiting, which restricts repeated requests from the same IP address, necessitating responsible scraping practices.\n",
