        "## How can we make sense of the Shire's housing market?\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you're a curious hobbit named Frodo Baggins, and you've just inherited Bag End from your uncle Bilbo. As you settle into your new home, you start wondering about the housing market in the Shire. How much are other hobbit-holes worth? What factors influence their prices? Is Bag End truly as valuable as everyone says?\n",
        "\n",
        "To answer these questions, you could try to gather information about every single hobbit-hole in the Shire. But that would take years, and by the time you finished, the market would have changed! This is where **inferential statistics** comes to the rescue.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inferential statistics** is a powerful tool in data science that allows us to draw conclusions about a large group (called a **population**) based on a smaller, representative subset (called a **sample**). It's like tasting a spoonful of Farmer Maggot's mushroom soup to judge the flavor of the entire pot.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of our Shire housing market example, inferential statistics would help us:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Estimate** the average price of hobbit-holes in the entire Shire based on data from a few neighborhoods.\n",
        "2. **Predict** how factors like square footage or distance to the nearest pub might affect a hobbit-hole's price.\n",
        "3. **Test hypotheses** about the housing market, such as whether homes in Hobbiton are significantly more expensive than those in Buckland.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key concepts in inferential statistics include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Population**: The entire group we're interested in studying (e.g., all hobbit-holes in the Shire).\n",
        "- **Sample**: A subset of the population that we actually measure or observe.\n",
        "- **Parameter**: A numerical value that describes a characteristic of the population (e.g., the true average price of all hobbit-holes).\n",
        "- **Statistic**: A numerical value calculated from the sample data that estimates a population parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this chapter, we'll explore various inferential statistics techniques using our Shire housing dataset. We'll learn how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Perform **t-tests** to compare means between groups (Are Hobbiton houses really more expensive?)\n",
        "- Calculate **z-scores** to understand how unusual a particular observation is (Is Bag End exceptionally large?)\n",
        "- Interpret **p-values** to assess the strength of our statistical evidence\n",
        "- Use **chi-squared tests** to examine relationships between categorical variables (Is there an association between neighborhood and garden size?)\n",
        "- Conduct **hypothesis tests** to make decisions based on data\n",
        "- Explore **correlations** between variables (Does distance to the nearest pub affect house prices?)\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you'll have the tools to make data-driven decisions about the Shire's housing market – or any other dataset you encounter on your adventures through Middle-earth and beyond!\n",

        "\"Excellent, Primrose!\" Bilbo beamed. \"Indeed it is. We have data on 1000 hobbit-holes in the Shire. Let's explore what these numbers can tell us.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sample Size and Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "\"First,\" Bilbo pointed out, \"we can see that we have information on 1000 hobbit-holes. This is our sample size. We're looking at several characteristics, or variables: SquareFootage, Age, Neighborhood, GardenSize, DistanceToPub, and Price.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measures of Central Tendency\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now, who remembers what we call the 'typical' or 'average' value?\" Bilbo asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "A young hobbit lad named Hamfast piped up, \"The mean, Mr. Bilbo!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Very good, Hamfast!\" Bilbo nodded. \"The 'mean' row shows us the average for each characteristic. For example, the average hobbit-hole in our sample:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Is about 799 square feet\n",
        "-   Is about 30 years old\n",
        "-   Has a garden of about 499 square feet\n",
        "-   Is 1 mile from the nearest pub\n",
        "-   Costs about 3,495 gold pieces\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But the mean isn't the only way to find the 'middle' of our data,\" Bilbo continued. \"Who remembers another?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Primrose's hand shot up again. \"The median, Mr. Bilbo!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Excellent, Primrose!\" Bilbo smiled. \"The median is the middle value when we order all the data. It's shown in the '50%' row. For example, the median hobbit-hole price is 3,432 gold pieces. This means half of the hobbit-holes cost more than this, and half cost less.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And for our neighborhood data,\" Bilbo added, \"we have something called the mode. It's the most common category. Here, Buckland is the most common neighborhood, with 211 hobbit-holes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Measures of Spread\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now,\" Bilbo continued, his eyes twinkling with excitement, \"let's talk about how spread out our data is. This tells us about the variety of hobbit-holes in the Shire.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Who can tell me how we might describe the spread of data?\" Bilbo asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "A quiet hobbit named Marigold spoke up, \"The range, Mr. Bilbo?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Wonderful, Marigold!\" Bilbo exclaimed. \"The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. For price, the range is 6,743 - 1,447 = 5,296 gold pieces. Quite a difference between the most and least expensive hobbit-holes!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Another important measure of spread,\" Bilbo continued, \"is the standard deviation. It tells us how far, on average, values tend to be from the mean. For price, it's about 780 gold pieces.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Percentiles\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Lastly,\" Bilbo said, \"let's look at the percentiles. The '25%' and '75%' rows show us the first and third quartiles. For price, 25% of hobbit-holes cost less than 2,949 gold pieces, and 75% cost less than 4,003 gold pieces.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "As the young hobbits scribbled notes, Bilbo summarized, \"These descriptive statistics give us a quick but informative glimpse into the hobbit-holes of the Shire. They tell us what's typical, what's unusual, and how much variety exists.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Remember,\" Bilbo said with a wink, \"just as every hobbit-hole tells a story about its inhabitants, every number in these statistics tells us something about our community. In our future lessons, we'll learn how to use this information to make inferences and predictions. But for now, let's practice calculating these statistics ourselves!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The young hobbits eagerly pulled out their abacuses, ready to dive into the world of descriptive statistics under Bilbo's guidance. As they worked, Bilbo smiled, knowing that these fundamental concepts would serve as the foundation for their future statistical adventures."

In simpler terms, it tells us how likely our data (or more extreme data) would be if there were no real effect in the population.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Type I Error: Concluding the pipe-weed is harmful when it's actually safe.\n",

        "\"In this case,\" Gandalf notes, \"a Type II error could be more serious. We might choose a larger α (like 0.10 instead of 0.05) to reduce the chance of missing a real harmful effect, even if it means more false alarms.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now consider testing a expensive new farming technique,\" Gandalf continues. \"A Type I error (concluding it works when it doesn't) could be very costly. Here, we might use a smaller α to be more certain before recommending the technique.\"\n",

        "### Determining and Controlling Error Rates\n",
        "\n",
        "Gandalf taps his staff, and glowing symbols appear in the air. \"Calculating and controlling these error rates is a crucial skill. Let's explore how we do this.\"\n",

        "He provides an example: \"Let's say we're comparing two groups of 30 hobbits each, looking for a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.5) with α = 0.05. Statistical tables tell us our power would be about 0.7, meaning β ≈ 0.3.\"\n",

        "3. \"If you're exploring or screening, a larger α (like 0.10) might be appropriate to avoid missing potential effects.\"\n",

        "Seeing some confused faces, Rosie elaborated, \"Think of it this way: if we collected 100 different samples of hobbit-hole prices and calculated a 95% confidence interval for each, about 95 of those intervals would contain the true average price for all hobbit-holes in the Shire.\"\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Sample size**: Larger samples give narrower intervals.\n",
        "2. **Variability in the data**: Less variable data gives narrower intervals.\n",
        "3. **Confidence level**: Lower confidence levels (like 90% instead of 95%) give narrower intervals, but we're less... well, confident.\"\n",

        "\"Imagine,\" Frodo explains, \"we're trying to understand how the size of a hobbit-hole relates to its price. We could plot each hobbit-hole as a point on a chart, with size on one axis and price on the other. Linear regression helps us draw the best line through these points.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components of Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Dependent Variable (Y)**: This is what we're trying to predict or understand. In our case, it's the price of a hobbit-hole.\n",
        "2.  **Independent Variable(s) (X)**: These are the factors we think might influence our dependent variable. For now, let's say it's the size of the hobbit-hole.\n",
        "3.  **Regression Line**: This is the line that best fits our data points. It's described by an equation: Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε Where:\n",
        "    -   Y is the dependent variable (price)\n",
        "    -   X is the independent variable (size)\n",
        "    -   β₀ is the y-intercept (the value of Y when X is zero)\n",
        "    -   β₁ is the slope (how much Y changes for a one-unit increase in X)\n",
        "    -   ε (epsilon) is the error term (the difference between predicted and actual Y values)\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Goal of Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The goal,\" Sam chimes in, \"is to find the values of β₀ and β₁ that make our line fit the data as closely as possible, right?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Exactly!\" Frodo nods. \"We're trying to minimize the overall distance between our line and all the actual data points.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method of Least Squares\n",
        "\n",
        "Frodo continues, \"We use a method called 'least squares' to find the best line. It's like trying to minimize the total area of all the little squares you could draw between each data point and the line.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This method finds the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed Y values and the predicted Y values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpreting the Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have our regression line, we can interpret its components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Slope (β₁)**: This tells us how much Y changes for a one-unit increase in X. \"If β₁ is 5,\" Merry suggests, \"it means for every 1 square foot increase in size, the price goes up by 5 gold pieces.\"\n",
        "2.  **Intercept (β₀)**: This is the predicted value of Y when X is zero. \"Though,\" Pippin laughs, \"a hobbit-hole of size zero doesn't make much sense!\"\n",
        "3.  **R-squared**: This tells us how well our line fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. \"If R-squared is 0.7,\" Frodo explains, \"it means 70% of the variation in price can be explained by size.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "Frodo reminds his friends of some important assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Linearity**: The relationship between X and Y should be linear.\n",
        "2.  **Independence**: The observations should be independent of each other.\n",
        "3.  **Homoscedasticity**: The spread of residuals should be consistent across all levels of X.\n",
        "4.  **Normality**: The residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We need to check these assumptions,\" Frodo warns, \"to make sure our regression is valid.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "\"But what if we think price depends on more than just size?\" Sam wonders.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Great question!\" Frodo replies. \"We can use multiple linear regression to include more variables. Our equation would look like:\n",
        "\n",
        "Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ... + βₙXₙ + ε\n",
        "\n",
        "Where each X represents a different independent variable, like size, garden area, distance to the nearest pub, and so on.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"So,\" Pippin summarizes, \"we can use this to predict the price of a hobbit-hole based on its features?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Exactly!\" Frodo beams. \"But remember, it's not perfect. There's always some uncertainty in our predictions. That's why we often include confidence intervals (and p-values) with our estimates.\""

        "### Expanding Our Hobbit-Hole Price Model: What's Changed?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, we've expanded our simple model include more factors. Let's see what's changed and what it means for our understanding of hobbit-hole prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **R-squared: More Explanation, But at What Cost?**\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Old R-squared: 0.713\n",
        "   New R-squared: 0.796\n",
        "\n",
        "   Our new model explains about 79.6% of the variation in prices, up from 71.3%. That's an improvement! But remember, adding more variables will always increase R-squared, even if those variables aren't truly important. It's like adding more ingredients to a soup - it might make it more complex, but not necessarily tastier!\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **New Variables: What Else Affects Price?**\n",
        "\n",
        "   We've added Neighborhood, Age, GardenSize, and DistanceToPub to our model. Let's look at their impacts:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Neighborhood: Different neighborhoods have different effects on price. For example, being in Bywater reduces the price by about 186.86 gold pieces compared to our reference neighborhood (probably Buckland).\n",
        "   - SquareFootage: Still important! Each square foot adds about 3.30 gold pieces (very close to our original estimate).\n",
        "   - GardenSize: Each square foot of garden adds about 2.14 gold pieces to the price.\n",
        "   - Age and DistanceToPub: Surprisingly, these don't seem to have a significant effect (look at those large p-values!).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Statistical Significance: Not All Variables Are Created Equal**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Remember our discussion on p-values? Look at the 'P>|t|' column:\n",
        "   - SquareFootage, GardenSize, and most Neighborhood variables have very small p-values (< 0.05).\n",
        "   - But Age (p = 0.949) and DistanceToPub (p = 0.783) are not statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Complexity: More Isn't Always Better**\n",
        "\n",
        "   Our model now has 8 variables (Df Model: 8) instead of just 1. This makes it more complex, which can be both good and bad:\n",
        "   - Good: We're capturing more factors that might influence price.\n",
        "   - Bad: More complex models can be harder to interpret and might \"overfit\" the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Tradeoffs to Consider**\n",
        "\n",
        "   a) **Parsimony** vs. **Completeness.** Simpler models are often preferred if they explain the data almost as well as complex ones. Our simple model with just SquareFootage was pretty good already!\n",
        "   \n",
        "   b) **Overfitting Risk**. Complex models might fit our current data very well but perform poorly on new data. It's like memorizing answers instead of understanding the concept.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   c) **Multicollinearity.** The \"Cond. No.\" (Condition Number) is quite large, suggesting some variables might be highly correlated. This can make our estimates less reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Does This Mean for Our Hobbit-Hole Analysis?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. SquareFootage and GardenSize are clearly important in determining price.\n",
        "2. The neighborhood matters too, with some areas being pricier than others.\n",
        "3. Surprisingly, the age of the hobbit-hole and its distance to the nearest pub don't seem to affect the price much (or at least, not in a simple linear way).\n",
        "4. While our new model explains more of the price variation, it's also more complex. We need to balance the additional insight against the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember, in statistics as in life, more isn't always better! Sometimes, a simple explanation (like our SquareFootage-only model) can be almost as good as a complex one, and much easier to understand and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, who's ready to debate whether we should keep Age and DistanceToPub in our model?\n",

        "## Correlation: The Hidden Connections of Middle-earth\n",
        "\n",
        "As the hobbits sat in the Green Dragon Inn, poring over their multiple regression results, a soft glow filled the room. They looked up to see the Lady Galadriel, her eyes twinkling with ancient wisdom.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Greetings, young scholars of the Shire,\" she said, her voice melodious. \"I see you've delved into the realms of regression. But there's another power you must understand: correlation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The hobbits leaned in, eager to learn from the Lady of Lórien.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Galadriel began, \"Correlation is the measure of how two things change together. It reveals the hidden threads that connect different aspects of our world.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She waved her hand, and shimmering images appeared in the air:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"See how the height of Mallorn trees correlates with the radiance of their leaves? As one increases, so does the other – a positive correlation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \"Now observe the relationship between a Dwarf's beard length and the time he spends mining. As one grows, the other diminishes – a negative correlation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \"Look at the correlation between an Elf's age and their wisdom. It's strong, but not perfect – other factors play a role.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. \"Now, witness the correlation between the number of Hobbits at a party and the amount of food consumed. Quite strong indeed!\" The hobbits chuckled at this.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. \"Lastly, see the correlation between the phase of the moon and the growth of pipe-weed. Ah, there is none – not all things are correlated.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points About Correlation\n",
        "\n",
        "Galadriel's voice took on a more serious tone as she explained:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Strength and Direction**:\n",
        "   \"Correlation is measured from -1 to +1. A value of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation – as one variable increases, the other increases proportionally. A value of -1 shows a perfect negative correlation – as one increases, the other decreases proportionally. Zero represents no correlation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Interpretation**:\n",
        "   \"The strength of correlation can be interpreted thus:\n",
        "   - 0.00 to 0.19: A whisper of a connection, like the faintest starlight\n",
        "   - 0.20 to 0.39: A gentle link, akin to a brook's quiet babble\n",
        "   - 0.40 to 0.59: A moderate bond, like the steady glow of Elven lamps\n",
        "   - 0.60 to 0.79: A strong tie, reminiscent of the roots of great trees\n",
        "   - 0.80 to 1.00: A profound connection, as unbreakable as mithril\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Causation vs Correlation**:\n",
        "   \"Beware, for correlation does not imply causation. The roosters of Farmer Maggot may crow at dawn, and the sun may rise, but one does not cause the other. They are merely correlated events.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Linearity**:\n",
        "   \"Correlation measures linear relationships. Like a straight path through the woods, it may miss the winding trails. Non-linear relationships, like the cycles of seasons or the growth of a hobbit child, may not be captured by simple correlation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Outliers and Influence**:\n",
        "   \"Just as a single drop of Galadriel's water can greatly affect a garden, extreme values – outliers – can strongly influence correlation. Always look closely at your data, for sometimes the unusual holds great power.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Restriction of Range**:\n",
        "   \"If you only measure the heights of Ents, you might think height has little correlation with strength. But include hobbits and humans in your measure, and the correlation becomes clear. The range of your data can hide or reveal correlations.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Wisdom in Correlation\n",
        "\n",
        "Galadriel's eyes sparkled as she continued, \"Correlation can reveal much, but like all powers, it must be used wisely. It can show us connections we never imagined, but it can also mislead if we're not careful.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "She gestured to the hobbits' housing data. \"In your studies of hobbit-holes, correlation can show you which features tend to change together. The size of a hole and its price, the age of a dwelling and its garden size – all these may be correlated. But remember, correlation is just the beginning of understanding. It points the way, but does not tell the whole tale.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### A Word of Caution\n",
        "\n",
        "\"And yet,\" Galadriel warned, her voice taking on a grave tone, \"beware the temptation to see correlation where none exists. The human mind, and indeed the hobbit mind, seeks patterns even in randomness. Not every correlation is meaningful, and not every meaningful relationship is a simple correlation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "As Galadriel's lesson came to an end, the hobbits found themselves looking at their data with new eyes. They realized that in correlation, they had a tool as subtle and powerful as Elven magic – one that could reveal the hidden structures of their world, if used with wisdom and care.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Now,\" Galadriel smiled, \"shall we look at your data and see what correlations it may hold?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The hobbits nodded eagerly, ready to apply their new knowledge to their beloved Shire.\n",

        "### Key Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **SquareFootage and Price** (0.84) \"The strongest thread in this tapestry,\" Galadriel noted, \"is between SquareFootage and Price. At 0.84, this is a very strong positive correlation. As hobbit-holes grow larger, their prices tend to increase substantially. This is not surprising, for space is valuable in the Shire.\"\n",
        "2.  **GardenSize and Price** (0.30) \"There's a moderate positive correlation between GardenSize and Price,\" she continued. \"Hobbits do value their gardens, but perhaps not as much as the interior space of their homes. A larger garden tends to increase the price, but not as dramatically as the size of the hobbit-hole itself.\"\n",
        "3.  **Age and Price** (-0.06) \"Interestingly,\" Galadriel mused, \"there's a very weak negative correlation between Age and Price. This suggests that older hobbit-holes tend to be slightly less expensive, but the effect is minimal. The charm of an old hobbit-hole might balance out any wear and tear.\"\n",
        "4.  **DistanceToPub and Price** (0.08) With a slight smile, Galadriel noted, \"The distance to the nearest pub has a very weak positive correlation with Price. It seems that being far from a pub doesn't significantly lower a hobbit-hole's value. Perhaps the joy of a longer walk builds thirst and anticipation!\"\n",
        "5.  **SquareFootage and GardenSize** (0.03) \"There's almost no correlation between SquareFootage and GardenSize,\" Galadriel observed. \"This tells us that larger hobbit-holes don't necessarily have larger gardens, and vice versa. Each hobbit seems to make their own choice about balancing indoor and outdoor space.\"\n",
        "6.  **Age and DistanceToPub** (-0.15) \"There's a weak negative correlation between Age and DistanceToPub,\" she pointed out. \"This might suggest that newer hobbit-holes tend to be built slightly further from pubs, perhaps as the Shire expands outward over time.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Significance and Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "Galadriel's voice took on a tone of wisdom as she explained the significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Predicting Prices**: \"The strong correlation between SquareFootage and Price suggests that size is the most important factor in determining a hobbit-hole's value. This could be very useful for estimating prices or deciding how to invest in property improvements.\"\n",
        "2.  **Independence of Features**: \"Many of the features show weak correlations with each other. This is actually beneficial for statistical analysis, as it means these features provide independent information about the hobbit-holes.\"\n",
        "3.  **Surprising Non-Correlations**: \"The weak correlation between Age and Price might surprise some. It suggests that older hobbit-holes retain their value well in the Shire.\"\n",
        "4.  **Market Insights**: \"The moderate correlation between GardenSize and Price, compared to the strong correlation with SquareFootage, might indicate that hobbits value indoor space more than outdoor space when it comes to price. This could inform decisions about home improvements or new constructions.\"\n",
        "5.  **Cultural Reflections**: \"The very weak correlation between DistanceToPub and Price might reflect the Shire's laid-back culture. Proximity to a pub doesn't seem to be a major factor in housing decisions.\""

        "As we bid farewell to the cozy hobbit-holes and lush landscapes of the Shire, let's embark on a new adventure into the realm of real-world applications of inferential statistics. The statistical tools we've learned - from hypothesis testing to linear regression and correlation analysis - are not just for understanding hobbit-hole prices or the potency of Elvish wine. They are powerful instruments used daily across various fields to make crucial decisions and drive progress.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the world of science, inferential statistics are as essential as a wizard's staff:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Medical Researchers use t-tests and chi-square tests to determine if new drugs are effective. For example, they might compare the recovery rates of a treatment group against a control group to see if a new cancer therapy is significantly better than existing treatments.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Climate scientists use multiple regression to model the relationship between various factors (CO2 levels, solar radiation, oceanic temperatures) and global climate patterns. This helps in predicting future climate trends and understanding the impact of human activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Psychologists often use correlation analysis to explore relationships between different aspects of human behavior or mental processes. For instance, they might investigate the correlation between stress levels and sleep quality.\n",
